BMI Calculator App
This is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator built using Flutter. The app allows users to input their weight and height, and it calculates and displays their BMI. It also provides a basic interpretation of the BMI result.

Features
1. User-Friendly Interface
The BMI Calculator app features a simple and intuitive interface designed for ease of use. Users can quickly input their height and weight using the clean, uncluttered design. The app provides clear instructions and guidance to ensure the user understands how to use the calculator effectively.

2. Accurate BMI Calculation
Once the user inputs their height and weight, the app calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI) instantly. The formula used for the BMI calculation is based on the standard method:

BMI = WEIGHT(KG)/HEIGHT(M)^2
